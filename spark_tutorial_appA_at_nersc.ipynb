Complete information is available at [spark-distributed-analytic-framework](www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/data-analytics-2/spark-distributed-analytic-framework/). Note that you can use both Scala and Python API. In addition for the Scala API, you will need to load the `sbt` module to compile your libraries."
