# Learning Apache Spark by the example

Welcome to the series of notebooks on Apache Spark! The main goal of this series is to get familiar with Apache Spark, and in particular its Python API called PySpark. It is by no means complete, and
I might have done many errors, left many typos, and some parts might be deprecated. Feel free to open an issue ([@JulienPeloton](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/spark-tutorials/issues/new?body=@JulienPeloton)) if this is the case!
